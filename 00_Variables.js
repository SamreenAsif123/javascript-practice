//JavaScript variable can be declared in 4 ways:
//Automatically
//Using var
//Using let
//Using const

//Automatically:

x = 3
y = 3
a = x + y

//but it  is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

//using var

var a = 3;
var b = 3
var c = a + b 

//The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
//The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.


//using let 

let price1 = 34;
let price2 = 31;
let totalPrice = price1 + price2;

//using const 

const age1 = 23;
const age2 = 20;
const totalAge = age1 + age2;

 //remember that in JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operato . assignment opreator means you are assigning value to that variable.
